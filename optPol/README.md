# **Optimal Policy for Bernoulli Bandits**
Provides various classes to (multi-thread) compute: 
* Optimal policy for k-arms, time horizon, and Beta prior
* Efficient implementation of indexing scheme including its correctness test
* Configurations iterator
* Expected value per time horizon and Beta prior
* Reachability 

See [OptPol.cpp](OptPol.cpp) for C++ implementation.
